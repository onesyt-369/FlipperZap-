Goal
Create a new project FlipperZap from the current ToyResaleWizard code, with a light UI rebrand and a couple of route aliases. Keep the backend/data as-is so demo keeps working. No new features yet.

A) Repo & IDs
Do NOT modify the ToyResaleWizard repo.

Create a new repo named FlipperZap (copy of current code).

Set mobile identifiers in FlipperZap:

iOS bundle ID: com.flipperzap.app

Android applicationId: com.flipperzap.app

App display name: FlipperZap

B) Light rebrand (UI only)
Replace visible copy: “Toy / ToyResaleWizard” → “Item / FlipperZap” (titles, headings, buttons).

Keep all flows identical: scan → results → comps/estimate → create listing → contact.

Do not change DB table names yet.

C) Backend compatibility (no risky migrations)
Keep existing endpoints working.

Add aliases that hit the same handlers:

POST /api/v1/analysis/analyze-item → same as current analyze-toy

GET /api/v1/pricing/history/{item_name} → reuse toy history logic

GET /api/v1/pricing/estimate?... (unchanged)

If easy, add a SQL view: item_analysis → SELECT * FROM toy_analysis (optional).

D) Config & DEMO mode
Copy .env.example files to the new repo (frontend + backend).

Default flags to demo so it runs with no keys:

ini
Copy
Edit
APP_ENV=demo
ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=mock
PRICING_PROVIDER=mock
EMAIL_PROVIDER=log
PAYMENTS_PROVIDER=demo
Affiliate tags read from env (same as toy build).

Ensure bad/missing provider keys fail gracefully back to mock.

E) Mobile compliance quick fixes
Disable/hide Stripe buttons on iOS/Android builds (show “Available on web” link).

Make sure affiliate links open externally (Safari/Chrome, not inside webview).

If push isn’t fully wired, do not prompt for notifications.

F) Acceptance checklist (please verify on real devices + send a 30–60s screen recording)
Scan → Results shows item name, condition, value band.

Pricing history: renders or clean empty state.

Affiliate buttons open in the device browser with our tags.

Create listing → public /listing/:slug loads and appears in /sitemap.xml.

Contact seller → success toast; email logged in demo.

The new alias route /api/v1/analysis/analyze-item returns a valid response.

iOS/Android builds compile with the new IDs and app name.

G) Deliverables
Link to the new FlipperZap repo.

Short note of what changed (UI copy + route aliases + IDs).

TestFlight (internal) build + Android .aab in Closed testing (both still DEMO).

The 30–60s device recording of the happy path.

Do not add new features yet. This is only a rename + alias + IDs pass so my son can start building FlipperZap features in new PRs.

Thanks!

When they confirm done, ping me and I’ll hand your son a tiny “first PR” list (bulk CSV import + saved searches + price alerts) so he can start shipping features immediately while you jump to HugeMouth.
