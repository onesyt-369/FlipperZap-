Hey [Name] ‚Äî great work getting the app build ready for Xcode/Android Studio üôå
To finish and submit, can you confirm/provide the items below? I want zero surprises at review time.

1) Tech readiness (backend + PWA)
‚úÖ Deployed API base URL(s) for staging/prod (HTTPS):

VITE_API_BASE = ______

‚úÖ Health checks: /healthz, /readyz return 200.

‚úÖ DEMO mode works end-to-end with no real API keys.

‚úÖ .env.example (front + back) includes all flags/keys and defaults to demo.

‚úÖ Provider flags wired: ANALYSIS_PROVIDER, PRICING_PROVIDER, EMAIL_PROVIDER, PAYMENTS_PROVIDER, etc.

‚úÖ Affiliate tags are env-driven and present in outbound links.

‚úÖ Public listing pages render with JSON-LD and are included in /sitemap.xml (indexable over HTTPS).

2) iOS build (Xcode)
App ID/bundle ID set (e.g., com.ourco.flipperzap).

Automatic signing on; a build that runs on a physical device.

Info.plist privacy strings added:

NSCameraUsageDescription

NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription

NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription

App Transport Security compliant (our API over HTTPS; no ATS exceptions).

Payments policy: If Stripe is used for digital features, hide/disable those buttons on iOS for v1 (no external payments for digital content) and add a ‚ÄúAvailable on web‚Äù link.

Archive/Distribution settings verified (TestFlight build compiles).

3) Android build (Android Studio)
applicationId, min/target SDK, versionCode/name set.

Manifest permissions: CAMERA, INTERNET.

Release App Bundle (.aab) builds with signing config.

Payments policy: If Stripe is used for digital features, hide/disable those buttons on Android for v1 (Play Billing required) and add a ‚ÄúAvailable on web‚Äù link.

4) Store assets & metadata (please provide files/text)
App name, short description/subtitle, full description.

App icons (iOS & Android, all sizes) + splash screen.

6‚Äì8 screenshots per platform (placeholder ok for first submit) + optional short screen recording.

Category, keywords, support email, marketing URL, Privacy Policy URL, Terms of Service URL.

Data Safety (Android) / Privacy ‚ÄúData Collection‚Äù (iOS) questionnaire: list data types used (camera, user content, contact, analytics).

Third-party SDK list (if any) for disclosure.

5) In-app UX polish (quick wins)
External browser for affiliate links (do not open inside webview).

‚ÄúShare‚Äù button on Results/Listing pages (copies public URL / native share sheet).

Client-side image compression before upload.

Double-submit guards on ‚ÄúList‚Äù and ‚ÄúContact Seller‚Äù.

Basic rate limits (scans/messages) to avoid abuse.

6) QA & acceptance
Please run on real iOS and Android devices and share a 30‚Äì60s screen recording showing:

Scan ‚Üí Results (name, condition, price band).

Pricing history (or clean empty state).

Affiliate buttons opening externally.

Create Listing ‚Üí public /listing/:slug loads; shows in /sitemap.xml.

Contact Seller ‚Üí success toast; logged email in demo mode.

Flip a provider flag to a non-configured value and confirm graceful fallback to mock.

7) Hand-off docs (repo)
README.md with local run, build, deploy, and env setup.

RUNBOOK.md (logs, common errors, rotating env, health checks).

.env.example (front/back).

postman_collection.json or .http requests for all endpoints.

iOS/Android readmes with step-by-step archive instructions.

Keystore/provisioning instructions (how we‚Äôll handle signing on our side).

Once these are done: we‚Äôll upload screenshots/text, create TestFlight / Closed Testing tracks, and submit for review.

Can you confirm what‚Äôs already complete and give me an ETA for anything missing? If you need any copy (descriptions, privacy policy/TOS), say the word and I‚Äôll drop it in.

Thank you! üöÄ

Want me to also draft the Privacy Policy & TOS starter pages and the App Store/Play listing copy?
